# Sway Lab

Code samples used while working on the [Sway programming language](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway).

The distinguished folders in this repository are prefixed with:
- `I` for [issues](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues)
- `P` for [pull requests](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pulls)
- `R` for [requests for comments](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-rfcs)
- `D` for code samples comming from the documentation, e.g., [The Sway Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/)

Folders without prefix are random explorations.

Samples are by default written in Sway. When comparing behavior and features of different languages, samples in a particular language are stored into separate folder with the language name, e.g., _rust_, or _csharp_. Samples stored in _tests_ folder are meant to be copied over to Sway _e2e_vm_tests_ and executed as Sway tests.
