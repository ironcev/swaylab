# Sway Lab

_Sway Lab_ contains code samples and various helpful code snippets, that I've used while contributing to the [Sway programming language](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway).

The repository contains the following folders:

| Folder  | Content |
| ------- | ------- |
| Issues  | Code samples used while working on [Sway issues](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues). |
| PRs     | Code samples used while working on [Sway pull requests](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pulls). |
| RFCs    | Code samples used while working on [Sway Requests for Comments](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-rfcs). |
| Docs    | Code samples comming from the Sway documentation, e.g., [The Sway Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/). |
| Misc    | Miscellaneous code samples and random explorations. |
| qnd_dbg | Code snippets and tips and tricks useful for quick and dirty debugging. |

Samples are by default written in Sway. When comparing Sway's features with those of other languages, language specific samples are stored in folders with the language name, e.g., _rust_, _cpp_, _csharp_, etc.

Sway samples stored in _tests_ folders are meant to be copied over to Sway _e2e_vm_tests_ and executed as Sway E2E tests.

Sway samples stored in _forc_tests_ folders are meant to be run with `forc test`.
